## **CBAM** is a light weight attention module which was designed to be integrated as supplementary block to Convnets to enhance its representational power without increasing its complexity.

**It contains two main modules:**

1. Channel Attention Module (CAM).
2. Spatial Attention Module (SAM).

# CAM Equation:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
